# E-Commerce-Website

## Description
E-Commerce-Website was my first project, as specified in the project name, it's an e-commerce website
designed and built by myself when I was in the last year of my IT degree (2021).

NB: Before going further I would like to specify that this was an academic project, which means that is not a 100% complete project and 
a lot of improvements could have been made since I worked on it.
