# E-Commerce-Website

## Description
E-Commerce-Website was my first project, as specified in the project name, it's an e-commerce website
designed and built by myself when I was in the last year of my IT degree (2021).

NB: Before going further I would like to specify that this was an academic project, which means that is not a 100% complete project and 
a lot of improvements could have been made since I worked on it.

E-Commerce-Website contains two sides; the customer side and the administration side.

#### The customer side enables users to:
- Register
- Log in
- Chose and select items to add to the cart
- Manage the cart
- Choose the type of payment 
- Place an order 
- Purchase

#### The administration side enables users to:
- Manage users
- Manage items 
- Manage orders
